# VUE Boolflix

## Description
This project is a clone of the famous movie streaming platform : **Netflix**.<br>
<br>
I made this project using **Vue CLI** and "**The Movie DB" API**, wich contains lots of movies.<br>

## Features
- In this app you can enter **any film/series you want** and get the first 20 most popular results in cards.<br>
- You can also get the details of each movie/series by **hovering the mouse on a card**.<br>
- **If a certain info is not available, a red message will be shown**.<br>
- The rating returned by the API (max 10) is converted into 5 stars.
